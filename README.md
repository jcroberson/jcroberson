### Howdy!

My name is J.C. Roberson, and I'm a biomedical engineering student at Texas A&M! I enjoy coding outside of classes, and this profile is a place for me to store and share my projects. I'm most proficient in python, but am in the process of learning C#.

I'm currently investigating simple fluid simulations and various forms of visualization using code. 

### About Me

Outside of class, I enjoy reading, playing tennis (or just about any sport), watching movies, and, of course, coding. I also love making and appreciating various types of art, including painting, music and mebroidery. I've had work experience in a variety of fields, including as a tennis coach, camp counselor, and brain cancer researcher. I'm also a commited follower of Christ.
